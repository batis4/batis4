## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate software developer and UI/UX enthusiast from Yemen. Currently, I am in my third year of university studying Computer Science and continuously improving my skills in programming and software development.

I enjoy creating innovative tools and projects that solve real problems, such as my WhatsApp Unlocker tool and my AI assistant project called **SAM**. I have experience working with various technologies including C#, Next.js, React, Qualcomm diagnostics, and automation using ADB.

I love open-source and sharing my work to help others and collaborate with the community.
